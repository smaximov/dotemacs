Make a link to the executable appear somewhere on =PATH=:

#+begin_src bash
  $ cd ~/.local/bin
  $ ln -s ../share/cask/bin/cask cask
#+end_src

** Ruby

Install [[https://rvm.io][RVM]] to manage rubies.

*** Required gems:

- =rubocop= ::
     a static code analyzer enforcing guidelines outlined
     in the community Ruby Style Guide.
- =ruby-lint= ::
     another static code analyzer which focuses primarily
     on technical problems in your code.
