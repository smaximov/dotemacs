My Emacs configuration.

* Things I use

  + package.el + req-package.el for managing packages.
  + company-mode for completion.
  + magit for interfacing with Git.
  + Org mode for notes and stuff.
  + flycheck for syntax checking.
  + projectile for project management.
  + ivy + counsel as generic completion backend.
  + swiper as an alternative to isearch.
  + yasnippet (custom [[snippets/][snippets]]).

* Prerequisites

** Magithub

Magithub (at the moment of writing) uses two backends to access github API.

- [[https://github.com/tarsius/ghub][ghub]] :: Emacs Lisp package which wraps Github HTTP API.

     =ghub= needs Github API token, which can be obtained [[https://github.com/settings/tokens][here]]. After generating the token,
     save it in =/.authinfo.gpg= (don't forget to install GnuPG and generate a key pair):

     #+begin_src text
       # -*- epa-file-encrypt-to: ("s.b.maximov@gmail.com") -*-
       machine api.github.com login smaximov password <token>
     #+end_src

- [[https://hub.github.com/][Hub]] :: command line Git wrapper, used for Magithub (=hub= RPM package in
     Fedora).

     Before starting to use Hub with Magithub, you need to authenticate
     first. It can be done by running =hub browse= from shell inside some Github
     project.

** Lisp

*** [[https://github.com/cask/cask][Cask]]

Clone the repository:

#+begin_src bash
  $ git clone git@github.com:/cask/cask.git ~/.local/share/cask
#+end_src

Make a link to the executable appear somewhere on =PATH=:

#+begin_src bash
  $ cd ~/.local/bin
  $ ln -s ../share/cask/bin/cask cask
#+end_src

** Ruby

Install [[https://rvm.io][RVM]] to manage rubies.

*** Required gems:

- =rubocop= ::
     a static code analyzer enforcing guidelines outlined
     in the community Ruby Style Guide.
- =ruby-lint= ::
     another static code analyzer which focuses primarily
     on technical problems in your code.
- =pry= ::
     a ruby interactive REPL on steroids. =pry-doc= should
     be installed too. Required for the =robe= code assistant tool.
- =bundler= ::
     bundler manages an application's dependencies though its entire life.

** Markdown

Requires the =kramdown= gem to render markdown files.

** SCSS

Requires the =sass= gem to compile SASS/SCSS files.

** Rust

Install Rust via [[https://rustup.rs][Rustup]].

Installation locations:

- =CARGO_HOME= - =$XDG_CACHE_HOME/cargo=;
- =RUSTUP_HOME= - =$XDG_CACHE_HOME/rustup=.

You may also consider to add =rustup= command completions to
your shell by running ~rustup completions SHELL > DEST~, where
=SHELL= is the name of your shell (e.g., ZSH or Bash), and
~DEST~ is the destination where completion function is to be stored.

For my ZSH setup the following command will do:

#+begin_src bash
$ rustup completions zsh > $ZDOTDIR/completions/_rustup
#+end_src

Rust code completion achieved with [[https://github.com/phildawes/racer][Racer]]. Racer requires Rust
source code in order to work; the following command installs
Rust source code (and keeps it in sync):

#+begin_src bash
$ rustup component add rust-src
#+end_src

** ELM

You need to install following NPM packages:

- =elm= - ELM compiler and utilities;
- =elm-oracle= - a tool to query information about an ELM project's source code;
  used for completion.

** Fonts

First font family available is used:

- Iosevka Type;
- Fira Mono;
- Anonymous Pro.
